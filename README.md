# Stopwatch Web Application

I built a sleek and functional stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my web development internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features:

- User-friendly Interface: The stopwatch features a clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring ease of use for all stakeholders.
- Start, Pause, and Reset: Users can start, pause, and reset the stopwatch as needed.
- Lap Times: The application accurately measures and records time intervals, allowing users to track and display lap times.
